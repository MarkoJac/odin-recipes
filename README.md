HTML project
This project is meant to practice and demonstrate basic HTML skills in building a simple website.
I should demonstrate proper file structure, how to setup an HTML boilerplate, how to use relative links to setup basic website navigation, how to use paragraphs, headers, and lists, and how to link to images.
Aditionally, this project should demonstrate a basic understanding of the git workflow and how to push changes to github.
