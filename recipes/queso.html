    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This queso recipe is low calorie and high protein without compromising on flavor. It is a great way to satisfy cravings and add protein to your meals.
            It is super easy to make and can be modified to your personal tastes. It is meal prep friendly and stores well in the fridge for up to 2 weeks!
        </p>
        <p>Cottage cheese and low-fat skim cheese are great options here if you are in a calorie deficit. If you just want a high protein option and aren't worried about the calories cottage cheese can be mixed with your full fat cheese of choice.
            The secret ingredient here is sodium citrate, a flavorless cooking salt that causes the cheese to melt just like your favorite store bought queso options. You can make it yourself at home or simply buy it online ahead of time.
